# User Manage App

A User Manage app flutter project.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **User Management Application** built using **Flutter (GetX)** for the frontend and **Firebase Realtime Database** with **Vercel Serverless APIs** for the backend.

The application supports **full CRUD operations** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with **pagination-based user listing** and **individual user profile management**.

The backend is deployed as **serverless REST APIs on Vercel**, ensuring scalability and fast response times, while the frontend follows a **clean architecture** with proper state management using **GetX (Obx)**.

## 🧠 State Management Approach

This application uses **GetX** for state management to ensure high performance, scalability, and clean architecture.

- Reactive programming using `Rx` variables
- UI updates handled through `Obx` widgets
- No usage of `setState` in UI components
- Clear separation of business logic and UI
- Controllers handle all API interactions

## 📁 Folder Structure

The project follows a **clean and scalable architecture** to maintain separation of concerns and improve maintainability.

### 📌 `bindings/`
Contains GetX bindings responsible for **controller initialization and dependency injection**.

- Ensures controllers are created only when needed
- Helps manage controller lifecycle efficiently

---
